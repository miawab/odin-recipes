        <li><h2>Biryani</h2></li>
        <p>Chicken biryani is a delicious Pakistani/Indian rice
            dish that's typically reserved for special occasions such as weddings,
            parties, or holidays such as Ramadan. It has a lengthy preparation,
            but the work is definitely worth it. For biryani,
            basmati rice is the ideal variety to use.</p>
